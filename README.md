# CLA_ANN
Developing A Continuous Learning Approach for Spam Detection using Artificial Neural Network.

##Algorithm   
The algorihm used in the implementation can be found under the file 'Developing New Continuous Learning Approach for Spam Detection using Artificial Neural Network (CLA_ANN)' in this repository.

##Implementation   
R was used to implement this project.

##Test data   
All the data you can find was extracted in [https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/](https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/).   

##Improvements
- Improve the text manage used to extract words from an email. There are some words belonging to email format whose don't have to be considered as frequente word.
- Implement an effective code for continous learning. Our approach can reach any improvement in the final result.
